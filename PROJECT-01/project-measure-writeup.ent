macro:->The
buildLatexCorrelationTable()
function
was
a
crucial
function
that
was
used
to
construct
the
table
found
in
section
\ref
{sec:correlation-tables},
but
it
was
omitted
from
appearing
in
section
\ref
{sec:functions}
due
to
the
length
of
the
code
involved.
Instead,
code
for
this
function
can
be
found
on
Monte
Shaffer's
Github
repository
through
this

macro:->As
mentioned
in
a
comment
in
section
\ref
{sec:sourcing},
if
you
are
going
to
change
the
$scale$
value
from
TRUE
to
FALSE
or
vice
versa
when
invoking
read.file(),
be
sure
to
remove
the
previous
measure
file
from
whatever
you
set
the
working
directory
to
in
the
$path.to.secret$
variable.
This
is
because
no
feature
was
implemented
to
remove
the
previous
file
after
switching
the
value
of
$scale$
due
to
time
constraints.

macro:->Access
times
were
not
a
huge
problem
for
this
data
set
as
the
original
size
of
the
data
set
was
only
composed
of
428
observations
and
the
research
code
was
executed
on
a
fairly
high-end
computer,
however
it
makes
for
good
practice
when
it
comes
time
to
work
on
larger
data
sets
down
the
road.
